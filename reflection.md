# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]

I'm a MS student in the Clinical and Epidemiological Research Program and I'm also a Full-time Clinical Research Coordinator in the Epilepsy Center here at UCSF. Before this, I studied neurosciene at Cornell and worked as a research assistant at CDPH's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention program. Fun fact: I have a cat named Wasabi and she looks like a mini Maine Coon but she is far from pure bred.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]

I'm applying to med schools this spring and hope to become a physcian scientist. I want to learn python so I can begin building the skills to build complex models, analyze heeps of neuroimaging data, and find creative ways to use mlms amidst this new buzz about AI. I initially wanted a double major of CS and neuroscience in undergrad put I'm hoping I can supplement my interests a bit with this masters in the data science track.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
learning python! It opens up a whole world of possibilities. I feel like I'll get super powers. I can do anything with python! SO much more useful outside of my professional life than languages like R or STATA.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]

****My whole family is from Haiti and moving to the West coast has felt a bit lonely since the haitian population is so small here.
There is only one AUTHENTIC (kinda) Haitian restaurant in the Bay Area and I got there any time I miss home.
